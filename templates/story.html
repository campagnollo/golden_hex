                Golden Hex story started in California, where a family of beekeepers decided to share their love of raw honey with friends and family in Silicon Valley.
                Soon, the word about the quality of the honey spread, and requests poured in. This led to selling bee products to Bay Area and Los Angeles customers.
                Our company kept growing, producing the finest raw honey, pollen, propolis, candies, natural cosmetics, and soaps.
                Upon moving to North Carolina, we expanded our brand by opening a specialty store offering European and Mediterranean products.
                The Golden Hex store continues to offer raw honey and other natural products now produced in North Carolina.
                Conveniently located at 1200 NW Maynard Rd, Cary, NC, next to downtown Cary and Thomas Bond Park.
