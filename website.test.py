This script uses Playwright to automate browser interactions for testing a website.

Steps performed by the script:
1. Start Playwright and launch a Chromium browser instance.
2. Open a new browser page with JavaScript enabled.
3. Navigate to the specified URL and wait for the page to load.
4. Locate the dropdown toggle button using XPath and wait for it to be attached and visible.
5. Scroll the dropdown toggle button into view if it is off-screen.
6. Click the dropdown toggle button to open the dropdown menu.
7. Wait for the dropdown menu to become visible.
8. Locate the Media link within the dropdown menu using XPath.
9. Wait for the Media link to be visible and clickable.
10. Click the Media link.
11. Print a confirmation message.
12. Pause for 5 seconds for debugging purposes.
13. Close the browser page and the browser instance.
14. Stop Playwright.

Note: The script assumes that the local server is running at http://127.0.0.1:8080/.
